## High Impact Inflation Attack
The inflation attack described in the audit report is a vulnerability that can affect the [[sDOLA]] vault, which is an ERC4626 vault.

The key steps of the inflation attack are:

1. The attacker deposits a small amount (e.g., 1 wei) of DOLA into the [[sDOLA]] vault, becoming the first depositor.
2. The attacker stakes a significant amount of DOLA (e.g., X/2 DOLA) in the DolaSavings contract on behalf of the [[sDOLA]] vault.
3. When the legitimate user tries to deposit X DOLA into the [[sDOLA]] vault, the user is minted a number of shares based on the current total assets in the vault, which is now inflated due to the attacker's deposit.
4. The attacker can then redeem their shares in the [[sDOLA]] vault, receiving a disproportionately large amount of DOLA compared to their initial deposit, effectively stealing a portion of the legitimate user's deposit.

The root cause of this vulnerability is the way the ERC4626 vault calculates the number of shares to mint for a given deposit amount. The first depositor can manipulate the total assets in the vault, leading to rounding issues that benefit the attacker at the expense of subsequent depositors.

This attack highlights the importance of carefully designing vaults and deposit/withdrawal mechanisms to prevent such front-running and manipulation attacks, especially when dealing with assets whose prices can be easily influenced, like in this case with the [[sDOLA]] contract.

## Report Analysis 
Hello, welcome to read the article titled "Dola Savings Audit Review." The document mainly talks about the findings and recommendations from the audit of the Dola Savings code repository and documentation. You can start asking questions like:

What were the high impact findings in the audit?->

What were the low impact findings in the audit?->

How did the developers respond to the identified issues?->

What were the high impact findings in the audit?

The high impact findings in the audit were:

1. The [[sDOLA]] vault is susceptible to the inflation attack. The first depositor can be front-run by an attacker to steal part of the initial deposit in the vault.

2. [[sDOLA]] should not be allowed to be borrowed in a lending-borrowing market. The [[sDOLA]] price can be manipulated with deposits to DolaSavings on behalf of the [[sDOLA]] contract, leading to a scenario where the borrower can borrow more than the actual collateral value.

The low impact findings in the audit were:

1. Consider implementing a two-step procedure for updating protocol addresses, as the gov state variable is key to the protocol governance.

2. Missing checks for address(0) on the [[stake(uint amount, address recipient)]] recipient, as funds can be staked by mistake to the address(0).

3. [[buyDBR(uint exactDolaIn, uint exactDbrOut)]] call with incorrect exactDbrOut might lead to overpaying for dbr, as the exactDbrOut amount might be different from the ideal amount.

4. Incorrect overflow check in [[setMaxYearlyRewardBudget(uint _max)]], as the accrued rewards calculation can overflow.

5. Missing [[sweep(address token, uint amount, address to)]] function as part of the [[sDOLA]] contract, meaning tokens sent by mistake cannot be recovered.

According to the audit report, the developers addressed the identified issues as follows:

1. High - [[sDOLA]] vault susceptibility to inflation attack:
   - Addressed in https://github.com/InverseFinance/dola-savings/pull/9/files.

2. High - [[sDOLA]] should not be allowed to be borrowed in a lending-borrowing market:
   - Addressed in https://github.com/InverseFinance/dola-savings/pull/8/commits/0c8f83a4afa5cb25513ed74060cf369ddd55d982.

3. Low - Two-step procedure for updating protocol addresses:
   - Addressed in https://github.com/InverseFinance/dola-savings/pull/4.

4. Low - Missing checks for address(0) on [[stake(uint amount, address recipient)]]:
   - Addressed in https://github.com/InverseFinance/dola-savings/pull/4.

5. Low - [[buyDBR(uint exactDolaIn, uint exactDbrOut)]] call with incorrect exactDbrOut:
   - Addressed by documenting the existence of the helper contract for users to interact with.

6. Low - Incorrect overflow check in [[setMaxYearlyRewardBudget(uint _max)]]:
   - Addressed in https://github.com/InverseFinance/dola-savings/pull/5.

7. Low - Missing [[sweep(address token, uint amount, address to)]] function in [[sDOLA]] contract:
   - Addressed in https://github.com/InverseFinance/dola-savings/pull/6.

The developers were responsive and addressed the majority of the identified issues through pull requests and code changes.

According to the audit report, the areas of the Inverse Finance contracts that were most vulnerable were:

1. The [[sDOLA]] vault:
   - The [[sDOLA]] vault was found to be susceptible to the inflation attack, where the first depositor could be front-run by an attacker to steal part of the initial deposit.

2. The integration of [[sDOLA]] with lending-borrowing markets:
   - The audit found that the [[sDOLA]] price could be manipulated with deposits to DolaSavings on behalf of the [[sDOLA]] contract, leading to a scenario where the borrower can borrow more than the actual collateral value.

These two high-impact findings were the most critical vulnerabilities identified in the Inverse Finance contracts during the audit. The developers promptly addressed these issues, demonstrating their commitment to the security and integrity of the platform.

Based on the developer responses in the audit report, the areas that the Inverse Finance developers do not seem overly concerned about are:

1. Low - Missing checks for address(0) on [[stake(uint amount, address recipient)]]:
   - The developers addressed this issue, indicating it was a valid concern.

2. Low - [[buyDBR(uint exactDolaIn, uint exactDbrOut)]] call with incorrect exactDbrOut:
   - The developers addressed this by documenting the existence of the helper contract for users to interact with, rather than fixing the issue directly.

3. Low - Incorrect overflow check in [[setMaxYearlyRewardBudget(uint _max)]]:
   - The developers promptly addressed this issue.

The audit report does not indicate any pushback or disagreement from the developers on these low-impact findings. This suggests that the developers were receptive to addressing these issues to improve the overall quality and security of the codebase.

However, the audit report does not provide any explicit comments from the developers regarding their level of concern or prioritization of these low-impact findings. The developers' primary focus appears to have been on resolving the high-impact vulnerabilities identified in the [[sDOLA]] vault and the integration with lending-borrowing markets.
