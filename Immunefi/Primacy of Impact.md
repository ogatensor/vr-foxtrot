**Primacy of Impact vs Primacy of Rules**

Inverse Finance adheres to the [[Primacy of Impact]] for the following impacts:

- Smart Contract - Critical
- Smart Contract - High
- Smart Contract - Medium
- Smart Contract - Low

Primacy of Impact means that the impact is prioritized rather than a specific asset. This encourages security researchers to report on all bugs with an in-scope impact, even if the affected assets are not in scope.
