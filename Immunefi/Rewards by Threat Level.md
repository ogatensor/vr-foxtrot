Rewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on theÂ [[Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2.3]].](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-3/)

[[For Critical. The calculation of the amount of funds at risk is based on the time and date the bug report is submitted. However, [[A minimum reward of USD 20 000]] is to be rewarded in order to incentivize security researchers against withholding a critical bug report.

**Repeatable Attack Limitations**

- If the smart contract where the vulnerability exists can be upgraded or paused, only the initial attacks within the first hour will be considered for a reward. This is because the project can mitigate the risk of further exploitation by upgrading or pausing the component where the vulnerability exists. [[The reward amount will depend on the severity of the impact and the funds at risk]].
- For critical repeatable attacks on smart contracts that cannot be upgraded or paused, the project will consider the cumulative impact of the repeatable attacks for a reward. This is because the project cannot prevent the attacker from repeatedly exploiting the vulnerability until all funds are drained and/or other irreversible damage is done. Therefore, this warrants a reward equivalent to 10% of funds at risk, capped at the maximum critical reward.

**Reward Calculation for High Level Reports**

- High vulnerabilities concerning theft/permanent freezing of unclaimed yield/royalties are considered at the full amount of funds at risk, capped at the maximum high reward. This is to incentivize security researchers to uncover and responsibly disclose vulnerabilities that may have not have significant monetary value today, but could still be damaging to the project if it goes unaddressed.
- In the event of temporary freezing, the reward doubles from the full frozen value for every additional 24h that the funds are temporarily frozen, up until a max cap of the high reward. This is because as the duration of the freezing lenghents, the potential for greater damage and subsequent reputational harm intensifies. Thus, by increasing the reward proportionally with the frozen duration, the project ensures stronger incentives for bug disclosure of this nature.

For critical web/apps bug reports will be rewarded with 50 000 USD , only if the impact leads to:

- [[A loss of funds involving an attack that does not require any user action]]
- [[Unauthorized minting of INV, DOLA, or DBR tokens on-chain]]
- [[Private key or private key generation leakage leading to unauthorized access to user funds]]

All other impacts that would be classified as Critical would be rewarded a flat amount of 5 000 USD. The rest of the severity levels are paid out according to the Impact in Scope table.

**Reward Payment Terms**

[[Payouts are handled by the Inverse Finance team]] directly and are denominated in USD. However, payments are done in DOLA.

The calculation of the net amount rewarded is based on the price between at the time the bug report was submitted. No adjustments are made based on liquidity availability.
