At Immunefi, we classify bugs on a simplified 4-level scale:

- [[Critical]]
- [[High]]
- [[Medium]]
- [[Low]]

The development of this scale took into consideration multiple factors that may affect a vulnerability and its likelihood of exploitation, but finalizes them largely by the impact that they cause.

The table below is mostly concerned with the consequence of a successful exploit. Keep in mind that if the exploit requires elevated privileges or uncommon user interaction, the level of the bug may be downgraded to reflect that or rejected.

A more in-depth discussion of each impact listed below is available on our [Help Center](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/13332717597585-Severity-Classification-System?utm_source=immunefi).

### Blockchain/DLT

|---|---|---|---|---|
|4. Critical|- Network not being able to confirm new transactions (total network shutdown)  <br>- Unintended permanent chain split requiring hard fork (network partition requiring hard fork)  <br>- Direct loss of funds  <br>- Permanent freezing of funds (fix requires hardfork)||||
|3. High|- Unintended chain split (network partition)  <br>- Temporary freezing of network transactions by delaying one block by 500% or more of the average block time of the preceding 24 hours beyond standard difficulty adjustments  <br>- Causing network processing nodes to process transactions from the mempool beyond set parameters  <br>- RPC API crash affecting projects with greater than or equal to 25% of the market capitalization on top of the respective layer||||

## Out of Scope & Rules

These are the default impacts recommended to projects to mark as out of scope for their bug bounty program. The actual list of out of scope impacts differ from program to program.

- Impacts requiring attacks that the reporter has already exploited themselves, leading to damage
- Impacts caused by attacks requiring access to leaked keys/credentials
- Impacts caused by attacks requiring access to privileged addresses (governance, strategist) except in such cases where the contracts are intended to have no privileged access to functions that make the attack possible
- Impacts relying on attacks involving the depegging of an external stablecoin where the attacker does not directly cause the depegging due to a bug in code
- Mentions of secrets, access tokens, API keys, private keys, etc. in Github will be considered out of scope without proof that they are in-use in production
- Best practice recommendations
- Feature requests
- Impacts on test files and configuration files unless stated otherwise in the bug bounty program

## Smart Contracts/Blockchain DLT

- Incorrect data supplied by third party oracles
    - Not to exclude oracle manipulation/flash loan attacks
- Impacts requiring basic economic and governance attacks (e.g. 51% attack)
- Lack of liquidity impacts
- Impacts from Sybil attacks
- Impacts involving centralization risks

## Websites and Apps

- Theoretical impacts without any proof or demonstration
- Impacts involving attacks requiring physical access to the victim device
- Impacts involving attacks requiring access to the local network of the victim
- Reflected plain text injection (e.g. url parameters, path, etc.)
    - This does not exclude reflected HTML injection with or without JavaScript
    - This does not exclude persistent plain text injection
- Any impacts involving self-XSS
- Captcha bypass using OCR without impact demonstration
- CSRF with no state modifying security impact (e.g. logout CSRF)
- Impacts related to missing HTTP Security Headers (such as X-FRAME-OPTIONS) or cookie security flags (such as “httponly”) without demonstration of impact
- Server-side non-confidential information disclosure, such as IPs, server names, and most stack traces
- Impacts causing only the enumeration or confirmation of the existence of users or tenants
- Impacts caused by vulnerabilities requiring un-prompted, in-app user actions that are not part of the normal app workflows
- Lack of SSL/TLS best practices
- Impacts that only require DDoS
- UX and UI impacts that do not materially disrupt use of the platform
- Impacts primarily caused by browser/plugin defects
- Leakage of non sensitive API keys (e.g. Etherscan, Infura, Alchemy, etc.)
- Any vulnerability exploit requiring browser bugs for exploitation (e.g. CSP bypass)
- SPF/DMARC misconfigured records)
- Missing HTTP Headers without demonstrated impact
- Automated scanner reports without demonstrated impact
- UI/UX best practice recommendations
- Non-future-proof NFT rendering

## The following activities are prohibited by default on bug bounty programs on Immunefi. However, projects may add further restrictions to their own program:

- Any testing on mainnet or public testnet deployed code; all testing should be done on local-forks of either public testnet or mainnet
- Any testing with pricing oracles or third-party smart contracts
- Attempting phishing or other social engineering attacks against our employees and/or customers
- Any testing with third-party systems and applications (e.g. browser extensions) as well as websites (e.g. SSO providers, advertising networks)
- Any denial of service attacks that are executed against project assets
- Automated testing of services that generates significant amounts of traffic
- Public disclosure of an unpatched vulnerability in an embargoed bounty
- [Any other actions prohibited by the Immunefi Rules](https://immunefi.com/rules/)
