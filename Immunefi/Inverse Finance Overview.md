### Program Overview

[[Proof of Concept (PoC) Requirements]]

Inverse Finance is a decentralized autonomous organization that develops and manages the FiRM fixed rate lending protocol and DOLA, a debt-backed decentralized stablecoin. Originally founded by Nour Haridy in late 2020, the protocol is now governed by [[Inverse Finance DAO]], a collective of crypto enthusiasts. Our code base is open source and maintained by the community.

Inverse Finance's main products are:

- [[FiRM a fixed-rate lending market]].
- [[DOLA, a stablecoin pegged to the US Dollar]].
- [[DBR, a new DeFi primitive that enables holders to service DOLA loans on FiRM]].

The [[INV governance token]] governs on-chain [[DAO voting]] and is traded on leading exchanges.

**Responsible Publication**

[[Inverse Finance adheres to category 2 - Notice Required]]. This Policy determines what information researchers are allowed to make public from their submitted bug reports. For more information about the category selected, please refer to our [Responsible Publication](https://immunefi.com/responsible-publication/) page.

[[Primacy of Impact]]

When submitting a report on Immunefi’s dashboard, the security researcher should select the Primacy of Impact asset placeholder. If the team behind this project has multiple programs, those other programs are not covered under Primacy of Impact for this program. Instead, check if those other projects have a bug bounty program on Immunefi.

If the project has any testnet and/or mock files, those will not be covered under Primacy of Impact.

All other impacts are considered under the Primacy of Rules, which means that they are bound by the terms and conditions set within this program.

**Known Issue Assurance**

Inverse Finance commits to providing Known Issue Assurance to bug submissions through their program. This means that Inverse Finance will either disclose known issues publicly, or at the very least, privately via a self-reported bug submission.

In a potential scenario of a mediation, this allows for a more objective and streamlined process, in order to prove that an issue is known. Otherwise, assuming the bug report is valid, it would result in the report being considered as in-scope, and due a reward.

**Previous Audits**

Inverse Finance’s completed audit reports can be found at [https://www.inverse.finance/audits.](https://www.inverse.finance/audits?utm_source=immunefi) Any unfixed vulnerabilities mentioned in these reports are not eligible for a reward.

**Feasibility Limitations**

The project may be receiving reports that are valid (the bug and attack vector are real) and cite assets and impacts that are in scope, but there may be obstacles or barriers to executing the attack in the real world. In other words, there is a question about how feasible the attack really is. Conversely, there may also be mitigation measures that projects can take to prevent the impact of the bug, which are not feasible or would require unconventional action and hence, should not be used as reasons for downgrading a bug's severity.

Therefore, Immunefi has developed a set of [feasibility limitation standards](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/16913132495377-Feasibility-Limitation-Standards?utm_source=immunefi) which by default states what security researchers, as well as projects, can or cannot cite when reviewing a bug report.

**Immunefi Standard Badge**

By adhering to Immunefi’s best practice recommendations, Inverse Finance has satisfied the requirements for the [Immunefi Standard Badge.](https://immunefisupport.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/15006865432209?utm_source=immunefi)
